"The Traffic Safety Amendment Act, 2020",Regulation,"These amendments appear to be intended to create a regulatory framework to give the provincial administrator the authority to issue vehicle permits for the operation of autonomous vehicles.

Of note, these amendments require that drivers be in the driver's seat and at the controls of the AV, which would preclude level 5 automation (fully automated) where the vehicle does not contain any driver controls.

Further, to minimize the mischief that can occur with automated technology, Saskatchewan's amendments contain broad provisions intended to prevent interference or obstruction of AVs by third parties","DIVISION 3

Application – rules of the road
75.3 Subject to the regulations, Part XVI applies, with any necessary
modification, to automated vehicles and connected vehicles.

Prohibition on operation

vehicle on a highway:
(a) unless that person is positioned at the controls of the automated
vehicle; and
(b) is capable of personally and lawfully operating the automated
vehicle, irrespective of whether the vehicle is capable of operating at a

The Vehicle Technology Testing Act ,Regulation,"This Bill amends The Highway Traffic Act, The Insurance Act and The Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act to allow for the testing of vehicles with automated driving systems or other new technology.

Under a technology testing permit, a vehicle or a new vehicle technology can be exempted from certain highway traffic law requirements.

A vehicle operated under such a permit may also be exempted from being insured through Manitoba Public Insurance. MPI may recover from the permit holder the costs of property damage and personal injury benefits paid out as a result of an at-fault accident caused by the vehicle.","PART VIII.1

Technology testing permits
318.13(1)
The minister may, in accordance with the regulations, issue a technology testing permit to allow a test vehicle to be driven for the purpose of
(a) testing a type of vehicle or vehicle technology; or
(b) evaluating the safety or performance of a type of vehicle or vehicle technology.

Content of permit
318.13(2)
Subject to the regulations, a technology testing permit in respect of a test vehicle may address any of the following:
(a) the training and licensing of the test vehicle's drivers;
(b) the test vehicle's registration under The Drivers and Vehicles Act, or its identification by other means;
(c) the insurance or other financial security required to drive the test vehicle;

O. Reg. 306/15: Pilot Project - Automated Vehicles,Regulation,"Ontario's regulation contains extensive guidance on AV use and tasks, while also providing clarity by defining what constitutes an ""advanced driver assistance system"" or a ""dynamic driving task."" 

In 2019, Ontario introduced important amendments to its pilot project regulatory framework. 
As part of these amendments, the province moved to open the way to public use of level 3 AVs and permit driverless testing of levels 4 and 5 AVs, along with co-operative truck platooning.","Note: This Regulation is revoked on January 1, 2026. (See: O. Reg. 306/15, s. 18)

Prohibition
4. No person shall drive or permit the operation of an automated vehicle on a highway, except as permitted by this Regulation.

Permitted use of automated vehicles
5. A person may drive or permit the operation of an automated vehicle on a highway if the owner of the vehicle has been approved under section 9 to test automated vehicles, and the vehicle is being driven only for testing purposes under the pilot project established by this Regulation. O. Reg. 517/18, s. 5.

Automated driving system requirements
11. (1) For a vehicle that was originally manufactured as an automated vehicle, its automated driving system,
(a) must comply with any applicable requirements of the Act and the regulations; and
(b) must comply with any requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Canada) that apply to automated driving systems for the vehicle’s year of manufacture.",Ontario,https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/150306,Autonomous Vehicle
Amendments to the Highway Safety Code in 2018,Regulation,"The Quebec legal framework allows for pilot projects and the authority to grant an exemption from insurance contributions. 

The Minister sets the rules and conditions for the implementation of any pilot project, and authorizes any person or body to use a vehicle in compliance with the standards and rules they prescribe. 
Pilot projects are conducted for three to five years and allow for cancellation or extension at the Minister's determination.","Amendments to the Highway Safety Code in 2018 not only introduced a definition of what constitutes an “autonomous vehicle”, but also opened the door to the implementation of pilot projects to test new modes of transportation and to regulate the operation of this new type of vehicle.

Testing an autonomous vehicle on a public road open to road vehicle traffic is only authorized when it is part of a pilot project. 
Only the Minister of Transport can authorize pilot projects to test new modes of transportation that make use of technological innovations while ensuring that the safety of road users is not compromised. 
Pilot projects usually last for 5 years, but can be extended by up to 2 years.

Putting an autonomous vehicle into operation on a public road is therefore prohibited, unless the vehicle is being tested as part of a pilot project. 
The only exception applies to vehicles with a driving automation level of 3, as defined by SAE International Standard J3016.
