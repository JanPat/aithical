Trustworthy Vehicle Localization with Deep Learning,"How to Achieve Trust with Deep Learning for Vehicle Localization? 
Deep Learning is a powerful tool for perception and localization for autonomous vehicles. At the same time, deep learning programs are often black boxes, with complex networks that lead to opaque methods of decision making which may fail unexpectedly. We aim to provide trustworthiness and robustness alongside deep learning approaches, by training the deep learning network to learn the sensing uncertainties and by utilizing deep learning as an additional sensor processing tool. Furthermore, by integrating deep learning with model-driven approaches, we use the learned sensing uncertainty to better quantify pose estimation uncertainty and provide protection levels for guaranteed safe navigation.",NAV Lab Stanford,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Code Design Using Machine Learning for Future Satellite Navigation,"Can We Rethink the Design of Satellite Navigation Codes with the Recent Advances in Machine Learning? 
On January 14, 2020, the first GPS III satellite was marked healthy and available for use, thereby marking the birth of the next-generation GPS constellation. In addition to broadcasting the new L1C signal, the modernized constellation is distinguished by its reprogrammable payload, which allows it to evolve with new technologies. Furthermore, the NTS-3 satellite signal testing platform is planned to be launched in 2022 and will explore new technologies for the future GPS constellations. Additionally, in a 2016 Request for Information, the AFRL has expressed interest in exploring modifications to all layers of the GPS signals. We are indeed entering a new era of satellite navigation. However, the legacy GPS codes are based on linear shift feedback registers, which were designed decades ago before personal computers. It is time to revisit the design methods of the GPS spreading code families. Powered by recent advances in machine learning, we explore new platforms for learning high-quality spreading signal families via genetic algorithms as well as a Natural Evolution Strategy machine learning framework.",NAV Lab Stanford,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
"Positioning, Navigation and Timing for Space Robotics","Can We Set up a GPS-like System for the Moon? 
We are entering a new era of Moon exploration. There are more than forty missions planned within the next decade by ten space agencies, not even counting the efforts of private sector companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. After more than fifty years since the Apollo program, NASA's Artemis mission will land humans on the Moon including the first woman and first person of color. Exploring the Moon also serves as a crucial stepping-stone for the success of future deep space missions. 

With the increase in human and robotic exploration, we must provide Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) services anywhere on the Moon. Current vision-based methods work poorly in the Moon's polar regions and not at all in the darkness of its night and permanently shadowed craters. We must also enable wireless network communication (e.g. cellular or Wi-Fi) on the Moon to support interactions among a large number of assets on the Moon.

On Earth, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides not only positioning and navigation, but also timing and synchronization for cellular communications. Can we set up a GPS-like system for the Moon at much lower cost? In this way, we can achieve better PNT services, as well as wireless network communication on the Moon, like what we currently have on Earth.

We are creating technologies for a ""Moon-GPS"", a lunar satellite navigation system with smaller satellites, perhaps as small as a shoe box, compared to existing Earth-GPS satellites which are as large as a truck. The lunar navigation satellites can function with clocks that are a thousand times cheaper than the atomic clocks on today's GPS satellites. The key idea is that the lunar satellite navigation system will listen to signals already broadcast by the Earth-GPS and process those signals to perform timing and ephemeris corrections. ",NAV Lab Stanford,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
High Integrity Sensor Fusion,"How to Intelligently Fuse Sensing Information to Achieve High Integrity? 
To ensure safe and reliable positioning of autonomous systems, it is critical to address not only positioning accuracy, but also its associated confidence, defined as integrity.  Indeed, claiming a 5-meter accuracy for an autonomous navigation system is not meaningful unless it is associated with a certain integrity level, such as a 95% confidence interval.  With a variety of sensors available to autonomous vehicles, such as GPS, LiDAR, camera and inertial sensors, can we really say “the more the merrier”?  In fact, including more sensing information can introduce more sensing failures.  It can also increase the required computation time, which is a precious commodity in real-time autonomous navigation applications.  We aim to intelligently fuse sensing information in order to achieve high integrity and quantified confidence for autonomous navigation.",NAV Lab Stanford,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Verifiable Perception and Navigation,"How to Safely Plan the Vehicle Paths with Sensing Uncertainty? 
Autonomous vehicles often operate in complex environments with various sensing uncertainties. For example, GPS signals can be blocked or reflected by buildings. Additionally, camera sensor measurements are susceptible to lighting conditions and yield poor vision performance in environments which lack distinguishing features. We aim to provide safe vehicle path-planning against sensing errors and uncertainties. We not only monitor sensing uncertainties, but also predict the characteristics of these uncertainties based on vehicle dynamics as well as environmental information, such as 3D maps. We apply formal methods, such as stochastic reachability to provide provable navigation safety guarantees.",NAV Lab Stanford,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Multi-Robot Collaborative Localization,"Can We Take Advantage of Connected and Collaborative Vehicles for Safety? 
The increasing number of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and UAVs, opens avenues for cooperation among robots through collaborative sensing and communication opportunities. We aim to leverage the abundant sensing information exchange among cooperating vehicles to improve localization robustness and safety.   For example, a UAV flying above tall buildings will have open sky views with ideal GPS signal reception.  Such a UAV can serve as a pseudo GPS satellite to relay the healthy GPS signals to vehicles near the ground with poor GPS reception and erroneous signal measurements.  We use graph theory and distributed algorithms to achieve more robust and attack-resilient localization solutions.",NAV Lab Stanford,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Fast Depth Completion on the CPU,"With the rise of data driven deep neural networks as a realization of universal function approximators, most research on computer vision problems has moved away from hand crafted classical image processing algorithms. This paper shows that with a well designed algorithm, we are capable of outperforming neural network based methods on the task of depth completion. The proposed algorithm is simple and fast, runs on the CPU, and relies only on basic image processing operations to perform depth completion of sparse LIDAR depth data. We evaluate our algorithm on the challenging KITTI depth completion benchmark, and at the time of submission, our method ranks first on the KITTI test server among all published methods. Furthermore, our algorithm is data independent, requiring no training data to perform the task at hand. The code written in Python.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Real-Time 3D Object Detection,"We present AVOD, an Aggregate View Object Detection network for autonomous driving scenarios. The proposed neural network architecture uses LIDAR point clouds and RGB images to generate features that are shared by two subnetworks: a region proposal network (RPN) and a second stage detector network. The proposed RPN uses a novel architecture capable of performing multimodal feature fusion on high-resolution feature maps to generate reliable 3D object proposals for multiple object classes in road scenes. Using these proposals, the second stage detection network performs accurate oriented 3D bounding box regression and category classification to predict the extents, orientation, and classification of objects in 3D space. Our proposed architecture is shown to produce state of the art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark [1] while running in real-time with a low memory footprint, making it a suitable candidate for deployment on autonomous vehicles.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Laser SLAM,"Laser SLAM is package which allows high fidelity 3D map construction using laser scanners and additional vehicle odometry information.

We have also used the package to build off-line maps for planetary exploration.
Most recently, the Laser SLAM package has been used to construct high fidelity maps used for vehicle localization of our self driving car.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Real-Time Filtering of Snow from Lidar Point Clouds,"A common problem in autonomous driving is designing a system that can operate in adverse weather conditions. Falling rain and snow tends to corrupt sensor measurements, particularly for lidar sensors. Surprisingly, very little research has been published on methods to de-noise point clouds which are collected by lidar in rainy or snowy weather conditions. In this project, we present a method for removing snow noise by processing point clouds using a 3D outlier detection algorithm. Our method accounts for the variation in point cloud density with increasing distance from the sensor, with the goal of removing the noise caused by snow while retaining detail in environmental features (which is necessary for autonomous localisation and navigation).

The proposed method outperforms other noise-removal methods, including methods which operate on depth image representations of the lidar scans. We show on point clouds obtained while driving in falling snow that we can simultaneously obtain >90 precision and recall, indicating that the proposed method is effective at removing snow, without removing environmental features.

Mapping Results

The following video illustrates how snow in Lidar data can severely corrupt a mapping process. In this video, we implement a full offline SLAM solution using GPS/INS and Lidar scans from a Velodyne VLP-32 driving through a snowfall event. We build a map with the snowy data (top) and then rebuild the map with the same dataset after removing the snow on a scan-by-scan basis (bottom).",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Traffic Light and Sign Detection,"Traffic light and sign detectors on autonomous cars are integral for road scene perception. The literature is abundant with deep learning networks that detect either lights or signs, not both, which makes them unsuitable for real-life deployment due to the limited graphics processing unit (GPU) memory and power available on embedded systems. The root cause of this issue is that no public dataset contains both traffic light and sign labels, which leads to difficulties in developing a joint detection framework. We present a deep hierarchical architecture in conjunction with a mini-batch proposal selection mechanism that allows a network to detect both traffic lights and signs from training on separate traffic light and sign datasets. Our method solves the overlapping issue where instances from one dataset are not labelled in the other dataset. We are the first to present a network that performs joint detection on traffic lights and signs. We measure our network on the Tsinghua-Tencent 100K benchmark for traffic sign detection and the Bosch Small Traffic Lights benchmark for traffic light detection and show it outperforms the existing Bosch Small Traffic light state-of-the-art method. We focus on autonomous car deployment and show our network is more suitable than others because of its low memory footprint and real-time image processing time.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Towards Autonomous Driving at the Limit of Friction,"Controller Description
The vehicle controller consists of four sections: speed proler, lateral controller, longitudinal
controller, and a traction control, shown in figure below.
The speed proler calculates desired velocities based on the path characteristics a certain distance ahead.
The lateral controller uses a full state feedback scheme to reduce the vehicle’s heading error and lateral
error. The concept of Centre of Percussion (COP) is used as reference point to introduce
some stability when tires are slipping. The longitudinal controller monitors the lateral
force required, and uses the spare forces to maximize longitudinal performance. On most
vehicles, a traction controller is a standard equipment; it monitors differences in the wheels’
spins to predict slip, and distribute longitudinal power to counter/minimize the slippage.
Many methods can be used to generate a speed prole for the vehicle. For racing
purposes, the desires paths are generated oine to optimize vehicle performance. Similar
characteristics can be achieved with a sophisticated path planning algorithm. For realtime
path planners, a spline method can be used to calculate the desired velocity.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Lane Marking Detection for Autonomous Driving,"The detection of lane boundary markings is central to the task of autonomous driving. While the detection of high-quality markings is relatively trivial, the detection of faded and degraded lane markings is a much more challenging problem. Detecting lower quality lane markings is also extremely important in countries with harsh winters, such as Canada and the northern United States, as lane marking maintenance does not keep up with their rapid degradation. As such, drivers in these regions encounter extremely degraded lane markings with persistent regularity, and any autonomous driving solution deployed in these regions must also address this challenge.

Our research in the detection of low-quality lane markings focuses on using a Bayesian Maximum Likelihood Classification approach to select the most likely lane markings present in an image from a set of candidates selected using RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC), with the Bayesian classifier trained using semi-supervised learning. Not only does this approach detect faded lane markings in challenging scenarios, but it also requires minimal human intervention in the training process.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Motion Planning for Autonomous Driving,"Path planning is a well studied and critical component of any autonomous driving system.  The ability to adapt to different situations and generate smooth maneuvers in real-time is essential to maintain safe vehicle operation and ride comfort regardless of the current driving environment.  In particular, path planning methods that can accommodate both non-holonomic vehicle motion constraints and obstacle avoidance constraints as efficiently as possible are needed to enable a safety layer that can react quickly in dangerous situations.
In our research, path planning for autonomous vehicles is formulated as a constrained nonlinear parameter optimization problem with vehicle kinematic and obstacle avoidance constraints in the continuous space domain. Given a naive initial guess, our method is first able to generate a refined initial guess by solving a two point boundary value problem in free space. Then based on the refined initial guess, the method deforms the path according to the performance index while satisfying hard constraints. This approach produces a curvature-constrained, minimal jerk path that is collision-free between initial state and the final state.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Informed Data Selection and Integrity Monitoring for Visual SLAM,"Informed Data Selection:
Visual navigation algorithms pose many difficult challenges which must be overcome in order to achieve mass deployment. State-of-the-art methods are susceptible to error when measurements are noisy or corrupted, and prone to failure when the camera undergoes degenerate motions. The visual navigation problem increases in difficulty when implemented on a micro aerial vehicle (MAV), as the low payload requires the use of computation platforms with limited processing power. Modern sensors, and especially cameras, are capable of streaming data with extremely high update rates, which pose processing challenges to the computationally constrained MAVs. To that end, the vehicle could be equipped with fewer sensors, or the data rate could be decreased to accommodate modest processing units, however, estimation accuracy degrades dramatically with fewer tracked features, and with low update rates. Ideally, the algorithm should be designed to evaluate the data streams, then actively configure the sensor cluster and select the measurements which contain the most valuable information for SLAM, allowing the MAV to complete its task efficiently. Informed data selection is especially important for cameras, as the image stream is generally very high bandwidth, and the image measurements, are especially prone to error.

Parity Space Outlier Rejection:
Camera egomotion estimation can become imprecise when outliers are present within the observed measurements. Typically, random sample consensus (RANSAC) approaches are used to perform outlier rejection, however the use of RANSAC can become computationally expensive for visual odometry, as the system state and feature reprojection error must be computed at every iteration. The parity space approach provides methodology to perform computationally efficient consistency checks for observations, without having to explicitly compute the system state. We have demonstrated two outlier based rejection techniques, Group Parity Outlier Rejection and Parity Initialized RANSAC which use the parity space approach to perform rapid outlier rejection. The proposed methods are applied to the LIBVISO2 visual odometry algorithm and are tested using the KITTI vision dataset. Experiments demonstrate the proposed approaches are able to compute solutions with increased accuracy and improved run-time when compared to RANSAC.

Entropy Based Keyframe Selection:
While many state-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithms use keyframes to help alleviate the computational requirements of performing online bundle adjustment, little consideration is taken for specific keyframe selection. In this work, we propose two entropy based methods which aim to insert keyframes that will directly improve the system’s ability to localize. The first approach inserts keyframes based on the cumulative point entropy reduction in the existing map, while the second approach uses the predicted point flow discrepancy to select keyframes which best initializes new features for the camera to track against in the future. We implement the proposed methods within the Multi-Camera Parallel Mapping and Tracking framework, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods using ground truth data collected using an indoor positioning system.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Multi-Camera Parallel Tracking and Mapping in Snow-Laden Environments,"Multi-Camera Parallel Tracking and Mapping in Snow-Laden Environments:
Robot deployment in open snow-covered environments poses challenges to existing vision-based localization and mapping methods. Limited field of view and over-exposure in regions where snow is present leads to difficulty identifying and tracking features in the environment. The wide variation in scene depth and relative visual saliency of points on the horizon results in clustered features with poor depth estimates, as well as the failure of typical keyframe selection metrics to produce reliable bundle adjustment results. In this work, we propose the use of and two extensions to Multi-Camera Parallel Tracking and Mapping (MCPTAM) to improve localization performance in snow-laden environments. First, we define a snow segmentation method and snow-specific image filtering to enhance detectability of local features on the snow surface. Then, we define a feature entropy reduction metric for keyframe selection that leads to reduced map sizes while maintaining localization accuracy. Both refinements are demonstrated on a snow-laden outdoor dataset collected with a wide field-of-view, three camera cluster on a ground rover platform.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Non-Overlapping Field of View Multicamera Cluster SLAM,"Multi-Camera Parallel Tracking and Mapping with Non-overlapping Fields of View:
A novel real-time pose estimation system is presented for solving the visual SLAM problem using a rigid set of central cameras arranged such that there is no overlap in their fields-of-view. A new parameterization for point feature position using a spherical coordinate update is formulated which isolates system parameters dependent on global scale, allowing the shape parameters of the system to converge despite the scale remaining uncertain. Furthermore, an initialization scheme is proposed from which the optimization will converge accurately using only the measurements from the cameras at the first time step. The algorithm is implemented and verified in experiments with a camera cluster constructed using multiple perspective cameras mounted on a multirotor aerial vehicle and augmented with tracking markers to collect high-precision ground-truth motion measurements from an optical indoor positioning system. The accuracy and performance of the proposed pose estimation system are confirmed for various motion profiles in both indoor and challenging outdoor environments, despite no overlap in the camera fields-of-view.
Degenerate Motions in Multicamera Cluster SLAM with Non-overlapping Fields of View:
This article presents an analysis of the relative motion and point feature model configurations leading to solution degeneracy when solving the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system using multicamera clusters with non-overlapping fields-of-view. The SLAM optimization system seeks to minimize image space reprojection error and is formulated for a cluster containing any number of component cameras, observing any number of point features over two keyframes. The measurement Jacobian is transformed to expose a reduced-dimension representation such that the degeneracy of the system can be determined by the rank of a dense submatrix. A set of relative motions sufficient for degeneracy are identified for certain cluster configurations, independent of target model geometry. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing the number of cameras within the cluster and observing features across different cameras over the two keyframes reduces the size of the degenerate motion sets significantly.
Scale Recovery in Multicamera Cluster SLAM with Non-overlapping Fields of View
A relative pose and target model estimation framework using calibrated multicamera clusters is presented. It is able to accurately track up-to-date relative motion, including scale, between the camera cluster and the (free-moving) completely unknown target object or environment using only image measurements from a set of perspective cameras. The cameras within the cluster may be arranged in any configuration, even such that there is no spatial overlap in their fields-of-view.

An analysis of the set of degenerate motions for a cluster composed of three cameras is performed. It is shown that including the third camera eliminates many of the previously known ambiguities for two-camera clusters. The estimator performance and the degeneracy analysis conclusions are confirmed in experiment with ground truth data collected from an optical motion capture system for the proposed three-camera cluster against other camera configurations suggested in the literature.
Non-overlapping FOV Multi-Camera Parallel Mapping and Tracking (MCPTAM):
This thesis considers the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem using a set of perspective cameras arranged such that there is no overlap in their fields-of-view. With the known and fixed extrinsic calibration of each camera within the cluster, a novel real-time pose estimation system is presented that is able to accurately track the motion of a camera cluster relative to an unknown target object or environment and concurrently generate a model of the structure, using only image-space measurements.

A new parameterization for point feature position using a spherical coordinate update is presented which isolates system parameters dependent on global scale, allowing the shape parameters of the system to converge despite the scale parameters remaining uncertain. Furthermore, a flexible initialization scheme is proposed which allows the optimization to converge accurately using only the measurements from the cameras at the first time step.

An analysis is presented identifying the configurations of the cluster motions and target structure geometry for which the optimization solution becomes degenerate and the global scale is ambiguous. Results are presented that not only confirm the previously known critical motions for a two-camera cluster, but also provide a complete description of the degeneracies related to the point feature constellations.

The proposed algorithms are implemented and verified in experiments with a camera cluster constructed using multiple perspective cameras mounted on a quadrotor vehicle and augmented with tracking markers to collect high-precision ground-truth motion measurements from an optical indoor positioning system. The accuracy and performance of the proposed pose estimation system are confirmed for various motion profiles in both indoor and challenging outdoor environments.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Modular Deep Recurrent Neural Network,"Summary
The main motivation for this project is to improve the model of dynamical systems, beyond the physics based models, by incorporating measurements of the model outputs/states in the modeling process. This method of modeling is called Grey-Box which employs a White-Box model (physics based model) in conjunction with a Black-Box model (purely based on data). In this project, the main area of focus is the Black-Box part. We want to study and devise Machine Learning methods that can learn very complex models of real mobile robots which are hard or expensive to model, for example, a quadrotor. The idea is that having an improved model which can predict the behaviour of the system over an appropriate amount of time in the future, the model can be employed in a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme. Since MPC is a computationally demanding control method, the improved model can compensate for the model inaccuracies, hence lets the MPC horizon recedes much more than a single step at each control attempt. This not only saves computational resources on a small platform (such as a quadrotor) but also provides a more accurate control performance and let the vehicle follow arbitrary complex trajectories.

MODERNN

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are dynamical models with powerful representational capabilities which makes them suitable for modeling dynamical systems. However, training RNNs is generally difficult [1]. One reason might be the vanishing/exploding gradient problem [2]. There is an increasing amount of interest in using RNNs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and other temporal pattern recognition tasks. With the rapidly growing rate of advance in hardware, using Machine Learning methods in various engineering problems is becoming a trend. In this project, we would like to facilitate the usage of RNNs in modeling and control of systems with fast dynamics, such as those in mobile robotics.

A Modular Deep Recurrent Neural Network (or MODERNN) is a general form of a structurally deep RNN which benefits from a modular design that eases the process of employing various architectures while inhibits the user from re-deriving the cumbersome process of Gradient calculations. Introducing a structural depth increases the modeling capacity of a MODERNN [3].

We have shown that MDOERNN outperforms two widely used methods in modeling and control of dynamical systems, namely Non-linear AutoRegressive eXogenous model (NARX) and Recurrent MultiLayer Perceptron (RMLP) in modeling the altitude of a simulated quadrotor. In [4] we have shown that MODERNN can be model a full-nonlinear dynamic model of a simulated quadrotor with no prior knowledge. The validity of the model prediction over more 5 seconds is illustrated.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
NASA Sample Return Robot Challenge 2012-2014,"This works presents algorithmic advances and field trial results for autonomous sample return, based on our entry in the 2012 NASA Sample Return Robotic Challenge. The challenge requires finding, collecting and storing pre-defined samples of different colors, shapes and sizes in an 80,000 m2 area in under two hours, without relying on GPS or magnetometer data and with a weight limit of 80 kg for the vehicle. We propose a system level solution to the sample return problem, and makes specific contributions in terms of mapping, planning and sample detection strategies that run in real-time on our custom platform. Field tests demonstrate reliable performance for each of these three main components of the system individually, and high-fidelity simulation based on recorded data playback demonstrates the viability of the complete solution.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Scan Registration using NDT and Point Cloud Clustering,"The Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) algorithm is a promising method for scan registration, however many issues with the NDT approach exist, including a poor convergence basin, discontinuities in the NDT cost function, and unreliable pose estimation in sparse, outdoor environments. This research propses methods to overcome the shortcomings of the NDT algorithm, in both 2D and 3D scenarios. To improve the convergence basin of NDT for 2D scan registration, the Multi-Scale k-Means NDT (MSKM-NDT) algorithm is proposed, which divides a 2D point cloud using k-means clustering and performs the scan registration optimization over multiple scales of clustering. The k-means clustering approach generates fewer Gaussian distributions when compared to the standard NDT algorithm, allowing for evaluation of the cost function across all Gaussian clusters, which guarantees convergence of the algorithm. As k-means clustering does not scale well to 3D, the Segmented Greedy Cluster NDT (SGC-NDT) method is proposed as an alternative approach to improve and guarantee convergence using 3D point clouds that contain points corresponding to the ground of the environment. The SGC-NDT algorithm segments the ground points using a Gaussian Process (GP) regression model and performs clustering of the non ground points using a greedy method. A region-growing clustering algorithm extracts natural features in the environment and generates Gaussian clusters to be used within the NDT framework for scan registration.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
Transverse Feedback Control for Path Following with Quadrotors,"This work presents a path following controller for a quadrotor vehicle. A smooth, dynamic, feedback controller is designed that allows the quadrotor to follow both closed and non-closed embedded curves while maintaining a desired speed, a desired acceleration or while stabilizing desired points along the curves. The nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor is transformed into a linear system via a coordinate and feedback linearization transformation. Once transformed, a path following controller is designed that guarantees invariance of the path while enforcing the desired motion along the path.adeel_0

A path following controller for a quadrotor helicopter is designed using the concepts of transverse feedback linearization and dynamic extension. This methods allows us to achieve the property of path invariance. The quadrotor can track a speed profile along the path or asymptotically approach particular points on the path.

We hope to implement the controller on a quadrotor platform as part of future work.",WAVE Lab Waterloo,Autonomous Vehicle ,,,,
